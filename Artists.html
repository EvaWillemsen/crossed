    <p class="tekst">A young woman, aged 24 ,from Liverpool UK started with music on the age of 16.<br>
      She got the inspiration for Folk-Rock music by her father, who was also a musician<br> and started making music round the sixties and seventies when Folk-Rock<br> was developed.
      Artists like The Byrds, Steeleye Span, Jimmy Hendricks, Pentangle<br> and Sandy Denny where inspirational for the British Folk-Rock what influenced<br> Goldie Snow to continue in this music style.
      Goldie worked with her father<br> and started composing her own songs,which led to 4 albums named: <br>Childhood memories, Lovely melody, Snow and Road trip.<br>
      She sings a lot about the past with warm feelings and what the future and her daily<br> life will bring.
      Her appearance makes you feel that she comes from the sixties<br> because her look and style are all based on the sixties, Goldie is a very warm<br> and a gentle person is eager to see what the future will bring for her and her fans!<br>

      We are so thrilled to announce her on our Crossed label night and can’t wait<br> to introduce her to all of you!</p>

      <p class="tekst3">Meet Indigo Blue; a new upcomming artist in the folk rock scene.<br>
With her 23 years on this earth she has managed to introduce<br> allready 4 albums!

Indigo Blue is a young artist from Nashville,<br> Tennesee (U.S.A.) who started playing music in a folk band with<br> friends at the early age of 8.  In this band she was the vocalist but<br> when they grew older she wanted to change things up an make a<br> switch to folk rock, the others weren’t in so she went solo.

<br>Indigo is know for her fresh take on folk rock music.<br> She likes to use the traditional ellements but with a modern twist.<br> She feels like it’s definitly very important to treasure the classic basis<br> of a genre and respect your roots nor or less stay true to your own<br> style and take on things by not being affraid of adding new ellements<br> without breaking it.

This is a very complex task that could easily break<br> the folk rock vibe, that’s why her succes in doing this so gently makes<br> her the singer to watch out for these comming years!

We are so glad<br> to announce that also Indigo Blue will be attending our <br>Crossed Records night, make shure u don’t miss her!!
